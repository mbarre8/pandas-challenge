In following challenge, we are analyzing a city's school district using two datasets in CSV files. The first CSV file is schools_complete.csv which contains a general overview of 15 schools in a city's school district. The second CSV file is student_complete.csv which contains a detailed dataset highlighting academic scores for all students in all schools in the city's school district.

Using the individual datasets and a dataframe combining the two files, I was able to provided a District Summary, School Summary, and highlight top and bottom performing schools based on both Reading and Math Scores. In addition, I was able to breakdown each school's scores based on grade level. Lastly, I was able to write scripts that analyzed the correlation between schools budget and student scores, and school size and student scores.

After cleaning up and organized the datasets provided a few conclusion were drawn. Firstly, when looking at the schools spending budget per student it seems like students with spending range $630 or less are doing better in both math and reading score and averages and overall passing scores. Therefore, if per student budget in a school higher that does not display a increase in student academic success. Secondly, small and medium size schools have more academic success then larger schools with greater than 2000 students in attendance. Another conclusion drawn is Charter schools excel in academics vs Ditrict type schools. When looking at each schools math and reading scores at grade level, there seems to be a steady trend between grade levels and only flucating by less 3 percent between the grade levels.
